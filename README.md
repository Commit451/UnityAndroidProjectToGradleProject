# UnityAndroidProjectToGradleProject
Takes the output project from Unity and converts it into a proper Gradle project that can be easily opened in Android Studio

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Commit451/ResourcesPoet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Commit451/ResourcesPoet)

# Basic Usage
```java
//TODO
```

# Why Not Just Use Import?
Android Studio does allow for importing non gradle projects, as highlighted [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/android-BuildProcess.html) which works really well. The main goal for this script is that it would allow for more of an automated build process.
